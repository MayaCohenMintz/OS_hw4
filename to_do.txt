TO DO
- create helper functions 
- figure out - what does pop_thread do? Why do I need to do 
thread->data=data after popping and before signaling? (line 217-219)
- figure out - why does a ThreadNode need the associated data?
- in line 244: why is visited incremented here? Where does the actual pop happen?
- difference in roy between dequeue and trydequeue
- in line 237: why do we need to check if th_queue.waiting is larger than size of queue?
- "else" in line 248: why do we only get here if size of queue is smaller than waiting threads?
compare this to first_draft, see how it is handled there
- in tryqueue, why is only queue.size = 0 checked?
